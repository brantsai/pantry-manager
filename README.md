# Pantry Manager

## About the Project

Pantry Manager is a smart recipe recommendation tool designed for home cooks who want to make the most of the ingredients they already have. Instead of wondering what to cook, simply add the items currently in your pantry, and the app will generate a curated list of recipe suggestions based on ingredient matches.

Whether you're trying to reduce food waste, save time, or get creative with what’s on hand, Pantry Manager helps streamline meal planning by showing you recipes that closely align with your available ingredients and identifying what ingredients you're missing.
